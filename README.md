9. API rate limiting
   - Learn the principle behind token-bucket rate-limiter algorithms and how to apply them in context of an API or web application.

   - Configuration settings for rate limiter

11. User model setup and registration
12. Email setup
    - Use `goroutine` to send email at the background
